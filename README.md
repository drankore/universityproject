Warcraft III - Avatar Map

Hello and Welcome to my University Project.

In this project I wanted to achieve two things:
1. To create a map as big as possible. (Completed)
2. To make it look like Avatar World from Avatar: The Last Airbender as close as possible. (Completed)
3. To create a Climate Control system which will add seasons to the game and make it more immersive. (Completed)
4. To create Experience System which will add experience to the units based on their effort in killing and destroing enemy units and buildings. (Completed)
5. To create a system which will control tree population. (Completed)

And other cool things, but... because of game limits which come from Original version and which still remain in the Reforged version (which makes no sense),
I've lost interest in further development and improving of this map. So feel free to download it and use it as you want.
